I felt joy when I explored new things, learned, pondered, and finally produced an output.",

I keep writing down various solutions in my notebook, try them out, and repeat the process.",

I consulted extensively with other developers and tested diligently.\nThe new structure and different usage patterns presented challenges, but despite the larger scale compared to previous projects, fewer issues arose.",

This choice was recommended in the official Vue.js guide and had also been mentioned during my frontend studies.\nSurprisingly, the development approach with Vue.js wasn't significantly different, and it actually provided an environment where I could focus on development.\nAs a result, server-side rendering was properly implemented, and we completed the project within a short deadline with minimal issues.\nThe reason I shared this case study is that it demonstrated how challenging a better approach, rather than stubbornly sticking to what I already knew, led to a superior outcome.",
